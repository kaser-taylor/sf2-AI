Notes: 
- Video #1 
    - gymnasium is a library of reinforcement library environments
        - he used it for flappy bird
    - So this video is gonna be super similar to what im trying to do cause rather than a computer vision projet is uses the memory values for various game components 
    - maybe research package managers and dev environments this might be needed doesn't seem nessecary (idk if i spelled that right) for the kind of work ive done so far
    - he says not to train a complicated environment first
